# Team Standards

This is a paragraph about this project.

## Coding Standards

Comment everything!

### HTML

### CSS/ Sass

All CSS should be in the SCSS directory (bring in vendor files, too)

### JS/ jQuery

## Workflow Notes

## Working in WordPress

### PHP Standards

### Keep Things Updated

### Advanced Custom Fields

Link the field group to template names not the page names

Use the standard metabox

Get specific with conditionals to only have things appear where they need to and to hide things that are unnecessary

## Working in Shopify

### Liquid Standards
